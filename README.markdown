This package contains a collection of functions for working with the TBESC2
TO 1 data (specifically, the downloadable extracts from DMS).  The functions
can be broken down into three groups:

# Functions for Cleaning Raw Data: clean_to1, rename, convert, recode, mix
These functions take the raw .csv extracts from DMS and produce an R list of
data.frames, each corresponding to a raw .csv file.  Those data.frames should 
generally have well-formated variables (character-coded instead of numeric,
dates are Dates, datetimes are POSIX, StudyId is available on every table).

to1_clean() is the only function you need; it applies the others appropriately.


# Functions for data quality checking
These functions underlie the TO 1 auto-QA report (link); they can definitely
be used alone but their outputs are oriented to that end.


# Standalone functions
These functions provide standalone functionality for study staff. For example,
gen_consent_checklist() produces a .csv file for every participant, with a
record for each consent document that participant should have and open fields
for the signatures that should be on it.

\title{to1check is a collection of functions for working with the TBESC2
TO 1 data (specifically, the downloadable extracts from DMS).  The functions
can be broken down into three groups:}
\description{
  Functions for Cleaning Raw Data: clean_to1, rename,
  convert, recode, mix
}
\details{
  These functions take the raw .csv extracts from DMS and
  produce an R list of data.frames, each corresponding to a
  raw .csv file.  Those data.frames should generally have
  well-formated variables (character-coded instead of
  numeric, dates are Dates, datetimes are POSIX, StudyId is
  available on every table).

  \code{\link{to1_clean}} is the only function you need; it
  applies the others appropriately.

  Functions for data quality checking

  These functions underlie the TO 1 auto-QA report (link);
  they can definitely be used alone but their outputs are
  oriented to that end.

  Standalone functions

  These functions provide standalone functionality for
  study staff. For example, #' gen_consent_checklist()
  produces a .csv file with a record for each
  theoretically-existing consent document for all enrolled
  particpants and open fields for each signature that
  should be on them.

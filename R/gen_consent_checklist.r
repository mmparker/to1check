#' Generate a checklist for reviewing consent documents
#' 
#' This function generates a data.frame that can be saved to .csv and used
#' as a checklist for reviewing participant consent documents.
#' 
#' Using participant demographics, this function generates a data.frame 
#' with a record for every document that needs to be reviewed, with columns
#' for each expected signature.
#' 
#' This is the expected use of this function:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item Generate the checklist data.frame
#'   \item Write the checklist to .csv using 
#'         \code{write.csv(checklist.df, 
#'                         file = file.choose(), row.names = FALSE,
#'                         row.names = FALSE,
#'                         na = "")}
#'   \item Open the .csv in Excel and tidy up the columsn
#'   \item Print the Excel document
#' }
#' 
#' The \code{na = ""} is essential - it creates the blank checkboxes that
#' you'll mark as you review documents. I realize this is a crazy mess, but
#' it's the inevitable consequence of converting a one-off script into a 
#' distributed function. Maybe it'll get refactored someday.
#' 
#' @param cleanlist The list of cleaned TO1 data generated by 
#'   \code{\link{clean_to1}}
#' @param enroll_start The first day of enrollments to review.
#' @param enroll_end The last day of enrollments to review.
